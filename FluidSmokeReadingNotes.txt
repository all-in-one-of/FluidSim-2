FEM: can break down a network of springs into individual chunks and represent each chunk as a volume (2d or 3d). rest state of the volume vs deformed state of the volume will reprsent some energy. the neg gradient of this energy is the force or desire to go back to rest state (if elastic). For a sping the deformation is uniform everywhere so given rest two points that map to two deformed points you can calc where a rest point inbetween will deform to.

PBD (pos. based dynamics) instead of connecting up particles with springs and using forces, everything is related through constraints Instead of spring S betwen particles you have constraint C between particles. example: these two particles should maintain a certain distance d.

fluid dynamics basics: good to have solid understanding of divergence and curl. divergence is a scalar function (returns single value for a point in space) that operates on a vector field (such as velocity vectors) greater than 0 means that if there were particles in the region then after a timestep t they would leave that region.  total number of paticles in that region is decreasing over time. So positive divergence means that the field is indeed diverging. less than 0 means the region is converging and particles are accumulating in that region overtime, the opposite of divergence. 0 means that it is divergences free and num particles in that region remains the same overtime (good for fluid as we must maintain incompressibility, i.e. no divergence)

vector fields can have each of its dimensional components represented as a scalar function that takes in a position (x,y) (2d for example). these two scalar functions (2d case) are called P and Q. If you wanted to know the velocity of the velocity field at a particular point in space, say -1, 1, you would plug in this position to both P and Q to get your velocity components for x and y respectively.

curl also operates on a vector field and returns a vector and tells you how much it is swirling at a point in the field given by the right hand rule and the general swirling motion of the vectors in the vacinity. if you imagine a little ball centered at the point in space you are interested in, the 3d curl is the spin on the ball due to the vectors in the region, mathematically it is the right hand rule vector spin along the thumb. magnitude of curl is magnitude of rotation.

==========================SIGGRAPH 2007 Fluid Sim Course Notes=============================
====Chapter 1====
for external forces you have gravity, user forces, forces due to pressure, and forces due to viscocity. imbalance of pressure acts as a force to move the water particles around. This is the negative gradient of the pressure integrated over the volume of the blob, or simply multiply by volume V for an approximation. Pressure is whatever it takes to maintain the fluids volume (incompressibility). Viscosity is like damping force in springs: it tries to resist deformation. Viscosity tells you how much a particle will want to move like its neighbors or the average velocity of nearby particles. This is done using the laplacian (a differential operator, upside down triangle dotted with itself or upside-down triangle squared). The laplacian measures how far a quantity is from the average around it. we'll use the 'dynamic viscosity coefficient' (dynamic meaning we're getting a force out of it; the kinematic viscosity from before is used to get an acceleration instead), which is denoted with the greek letter mu. 
eq 1.5 on page 16 has a ma=f kind of equation and then shows how to get to the final form. the material deriv. is like acceleration. and on the rhs you have a sum of forces, their symbols described previously. first is gravity, next is force due to net pressure and finaly the force due to viscosity. 

=1.3 Lagrangian and Eulerian Viewpoints=
The lagrangian view of a material is a soup of particles each with a pos and vel. The Eulerian approach, it looks at fixed points in space (where the simulation is tracked, in a grid) and measures fluid quantities like density, vel, temp,etc at each time step. For example, as a warm fluid moves past followed by a cold fluid, the temp at teh fixed point in space will go down - even though the temp of any individual particle in the fluid is not changing. In addtion the fluid variables can be changing in the fluid, contributing the other sort of change that might be measured at a fixed point, i.e. the temp at a fixed point in space might decrease as the fluid everywhere cools off.

An analogy constrasting the two: you're performing a weather report. In the Lagrangian viewpoint you're in a balloon floating along with the wind, measuing the pressure and temp and humidity, etc. of the the air that's flowing alongside you. In the Eulerian viewpoint you're stuck on the ground, measuring the pressure and temp and humidity etc. of the air that's flowing past you.  The reason Eulerian is useful is that it's easier to work with spatial derivatives like pressure gradient and viscosity with a fix grid (even regular spacing). It is also easier to interpolate/approximate those spatial derivatives on a fixed Eulerian grid than on a cloud of arbitrarily moving particles. The key to connecting the two viewpoints is the material derivative. material derivative is how fast a quantity q (some physical attribute pressure, vel, etc) is changing for a particle related to how fast that q is changing at a point in space. 

An example in 1D: we can have an experession for T as T(x) = 10x for initial grid state (0 at origin and 100 at x=10) and a wind blowing to the right expressed as u=c. We'll assume the temp of the particles aren't changing, so from a lagrangian viewpoint the material derivative is 0. however from the eulerian view point the rate of change (see the equations on page 18) is -10c. Meaning fixed points in space are dropping in temp at a rate of -10c. So the eulerian derivative can be anything depending on how fast and what direction the flow is moving.

A volume is represented with the Ohm symbol and its surface represented with the partial deriv. symbol and Ohm symbol. See page 20 for some derivation (volumne can't change so the integral measuring the total rate of change on the surface must be zero so that the volume doesnt change. The way to think about pressure in incompressible fluids is that it's whatever it takes to keep the velocity divergence-free. 

We can drop viscosity because most of the time we don't need it (smoke water most common, don't have viscosity, certainly not enough to warrant over complicating things).

The final equations (The Euler Equations: navier-stokes without viscosity(inviscid)) are found on page 21 (1.32, 1.33).

=1.6 Boundary Conditions=
for solid wall boundary velocity must have no component in the normal direction of the wall u_fluid dot n_solid = 0. This is similar to the gram-schmidt orthogonalization done in zero friction mass-spring solid body collision project. Or if the solid body is moving through the fluid, the fluid must match the vel in the normal of the surface u_fluid dot n_solid = u_solid dot n_solid. for fluids with viscosity you can simply just set u_fluid = 0 (not moving solid) or u_fluid=u_solid (moving solid).

For air/fluid interface we can set the air fluid pressure to an arbitrary constant: 0. then a free surface (i.e. water meets air) is one where pressure = 0 and we don't control the vel. in any particular way. 

For smoke in open air, at the boundaries the fluid continues, allow fluid to enter and exit the sim volume as it wants, so the boundary is a free surface p = 0 

For surface tension, a the free surface of water we add a pressure that acts to enforce surface tension. it is p = yk (gamma kappa), where gamma is surface tension coeff. (for water y=0.073N/m) and kappa is the mean curvature, measure in 1/m. Chapter 6 will cover how to measure kappa, the mean curvature of a surface. If you want to model air bubbles in water (they'll collapse with the 0 pressure assumption) you need whats called a two phase flow (because there are two phases or types of fluid). not covered here.

====Chapter 2 Overview of Numerical Simulation====
Splitting: splitting up the terms of a complex equation so that the most appropriate solvers can be used to determine each term separately, then add them all up at the end. 

we apply splitting to the incompressible fluid equations to separate out the advection part, the body forces(gravity) part, and the pressure/incompressibility part. see page 26 for these separations. advection must be done on a divergence-free veloctiy field so it must be performed AFTER projection(which creates a divergent-free field). 

Basic fluid algo:
- start with initial divergence-free vel field u(0)
- for time step n = 0,1,2...
    - determine a good time step deltaT to go from time tn to time tn+1
    - set u_A = advect(u_n, deltaT, u_n)
    - add u_B = u_A + deltaT*g
    - set u_n+1 = project(deltaT, u_B)

"determine a good time step size" just means make sure it is not past the end of the frame time (clamp it to deltaT = t_frame - t_n and set a flag indicating end of frame). a good deltaT is informed by the minimum time required among honoring requirements of the separate steps of the simulation(advection, forces, projection). Can be larger than this but you will get more numerical dissipation.

The Marker-and-Cell (MAC) grid is a staggered grid where pressure, density, temperature is stored at the cell centers and velocity is broken down into its components and stored on cell faces. for example, in 2d, u_i+1/2_j is the horizontal velocity between cells (i,j) and (i+1,j). in 2d, x stored on verticle faces and y stored on horizontal faces. non staggered versions are biased to the right and not as accurate, while this method allows for 'central differences' approach that isn't directionlly biased and is more accurate. 

**SEE PAGE 18 FOR INTERPOLATION FORMULAS**

====Chapter 3 Advection Algorithms====
we'll encapsulate this in a numerical routine as q_n+1 = advect(u, deltaT, q_n), which given a velocity field u (discretized on a MAC grid), a time step size deltaT and the current field quantity q_n returns an approximation to the result of advecting q through the velocity field over that duration of time.  

semi-lagrangian method of advection tries to apply the idea of the lagrangian form of advection (values of q don't change, the particles just move along the vel field) to the mac grid. if we want to find a value of q on a grid point at the current time we need to trace back in time along the velocity field to find out the q value of a particle that would have advected to the grid point. if the trace back lands outside of teh grid, we interpolate old value of q from old values on the grid. can either use normal forward euler or runge-kutta(rk2, see appendix A). forward euler would be xp = xg - deltaT*ug where xp is where the hypothetical particl would have orginated from, xg is where it landed at the current time on the current grid point and ug is the velocity field at xg (the point on the grid we are interested in updating). 

once xp is found, it is unlikely to be on the grid, so we interpolate nearby grid points to find out what the value of q would approximately be for the particle. you can use trilinear interp or see chapter 5 for one scheme documented in [FSJ01]. these particles are all hypothetical, no particles are actually created on the computer. the nice thing about this is that q is bounded and will never be greater than the max value of old q values. 

=Boundary Conditions=

=Time step size=
you can have deltaT as teh frame time but you get less accurate results due to greater numerial dissipation, what better is to limit deltaT so that the furthest a particle trajectory is traced is five grid cell widths: deltaT <= 5*cellSize/u_max where u_max is the estimate max velocity of the fluid. This can simply be max velocity stored in the grid. A more robust estimate takes into account velocities that might be induced  due to acceleration g from gravity or other body forces like buoyancy over the time step. in that case, u_max = max( length(u_n)) + sqrt(5*cellwidth*g) where u_n is the set of velocity vectors stored in the grid at the time of measurement.

=Dissipation==
The averaging operations we do to find q values (attributes of our fluid) will smooth out these features and lead to dissipation. If we are simulating a inviscid fluid, this will look like viscosity. If we are already including viscosity then the numerical disspation would hardly be noticed in comparision to the intentionally simulated viscosity. for smoke this will dampen the finer features like vortices. more accurate interpolation [FSJ01]  is partially the answer but often inadequate. later chapter will introduce methods to deal with this.


==== Chapter 4: Making Fluids Incompressible ====
the projection step will subtract off the pressure gradient form the intermediate velocity field u so that the result satisfies incompressibility inside the fluid and satisfies solid wall boundaries. for this, we need to be able to approximate the pressure gradient and divergence on a MAC grid. MAC grid makes accurate central differences robust, for example, where we need to subtract the d/dx component of teh pressure gradient from the u component of velocity, there are two pressure values lined up perfectly on either side of the u component just waiting to be differenced.

SEE TOP OF PAGE 39 FORMULAS FOR THE PRESSURE UPDATE (4.6-4.8)

These pressure updates apply to every velocity component that borders a grid cell that contains a fluid (not contain a fluid). grid cells will have three classificiations: fluid (contain fluid), solid (fully occupied by solid), air(nothing in them). At the end of the chapter we'll deal with fluid/solid cells (for now solids must line up wit the grid perfectly (walls), and we ignore the air/fluid mix cells at a free surface and just label them as fluid cells. for air cells (free surface) the pressure is simply zero, this is a "Dirichlet" boundary condition (directly specifying the value of the quantity at the boundary).

Pressure boundary condition at solid walls is u_n+1 dot n_solid = u_solid * n_solid. basically, the fluid inherits whatever the solid is doing at that grid location. This works out to be a specification of teh derivative of pressure( which techically is known as a "Neumann" boundary condition). 

SEE BOTTOM OF PAGE 39 (4.10) TO UPDATE THE BOUNDARY PRESSURE.

Importantly, if a solid cell has two more than one face that touches a fluid cell, we calculate pressure values for each face separately, all that counts is the pressure difference on the boundary, so we don't store pressure explicitly inside the solid grid cell(since there could be multiple values for it). we use formulas like  (4.10) whenever we need to know the pressure difference across a boundary.

Note that we are only ever going to evaluate divergence for a grid cell that is marked as fluid.

SEE BOTTOM OF PAGE 40 FOR DIVERGENCE APPROXIMATION (4.14)

SEE MID PAGE 42 for COMBINATION OF PRESSURE UPDATE AND DIVERGENCE APPROXIMATION TO DEFINE THE POISSON PROBLEM (4.22).  (4.24) is describing a certain case explained in the paragraph above.

We can put all this in matrix form. Ap = d where A is a large coefficient matrix, p is vector of pressure unknowns, and d are divergences in each fluid grid cell(with appropriate modifications to divergence at solid wall boundaries). We dont store A directly. Each row of A corrsponds to one equation, i.e. one fluid cell.For example, if grid cell ( i,j,k) is fluid, then there will be a row of the matrix that we can label with the indices ( i,j,k) . The entries in that row are the coefficients of all the pressure unknowns in that equation: almost all of these are zero except possibly for the seven entries corresponding to p(i,j,k) and its six neighbours, p(i ± 1 ,j,k), p(i,j ± 1 ,k) and p(i,j,k ± 1). (In two dimensions there are at most four neighbours of course.) We only have nonzeros ( i,j,k) and its fluid cell neighbours. It is of course pointless to store all the zeros: this is a “sparse” matrix.  A is also symmetric we only need to store half of the non-zero entries since the other half are copies.

This leads us to the following structure for storing A. In three dimensions we'll store the diagonal A(i,j,k)(i,j,k) and neighbor cells in the positive direction A(i,j,k)(i+1,j,k), A(i,j,k)(i,j+1,k), A(i,j,k)(i,j,k+1). we could call these Adiag(i,j,k), Aplusi(i,j,k), Aplusj(i,j,k) and Aplusk(i,j,k) When we need to refer to an entry like A(i,j,k)(i-1,j,k) we use symmetry and instaed refer to A(i-1,j,k)(i,j,k) = Aplusi(i-1,j,k).

=The Conjugate Gradient Algorithm=
The matrix A is a very well known and exaustively researched type of matrix, sometimes referred to as the five- or seven-point Laplacian matrix(in two or three dimensions respectively). There is one algo we'll use to solve this as it is both efficient and easy to implement, the "MICCG(0)", or more fully "Modified Incomplete Chelesky Conjugate Gradient, Level Zero".

See the rest of the section for explanation of whats going on. the residual should be 10^-6, used to decide when we converged enough on the solution, can also have a max iterations:100-200 is good.

LOOK FOR PCG ALFO AT TOP OF PAGE 47 (fig. 4.1). THE PARA ABOVE EXPLAINS SOME VARS.

=Incomplete Cholesky=
Some explanations about what it is and why its done the way it is. 
SEE TOP PAGE 48 FOR MIC(0) PRECONDITIONER IN THREE DIMS (fig. 4.2)
SEE TOP PAGE 49 FOR APPPLYING MIC(0) PRECONDITIONER IN THREE DIMS (fig. 4.3)

= Projection =
putting the following together, the project(deltaT, u) routine does the following:
-calc the divergence d(the rhs) with modifications at solid wall boundaries
-set the entries of A(stored in Adiag etc.)
-construct the MIC(0) preconditioner
-solve Ap = d with MICCG(0), i.e. the PCG algo wit MIC(0) as preconditioner
-compute the new velocities u_n+1 according to the pressure gradient update to u.


= Accurate Curved Boundaries =
estimating p=0 at the actual correct spot and not just putting it at the cell center of an empty cell. say we had a fluid cell(fluid exists at the center) at i and air cell (air exists at the center) at i+1 in order to create p=0 at the point where air and water actually meet we need to create a ghost pressure in the air cell(air exists at the center of the cell. otherwise the derivate has a discontinuity and that's bad since the central difference wouldn't be valid. so instead we think of what the pressure would be if the water continued up into the air, hitting zero at the air/fluid interface along the way. 

SEE PAGE 51 FOR FINDING PRESSURE ON AIR BOUNDARY CELL (4.35), (4.36). BE SURE TO CLAMP THETA TO EPSILON.

In the pressure equation, then, the only modification from before is to add (4.37) to the diagonal entry. the rhs (the divergence of teh old vel) remains the same.

SEE PAGE 54 FOR SOME SOLID BOUNDARY STUFF(NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IT IS)


==== Chapter 5: Smoke ====
To model smoke we need two extra fluid variables : temp T and smoke particle concentration s (the thing we can actually see). In reality, temp changes cause the air to change density however these changes are very small so we will use what is called the "boussinesq" approximation and assume constant density as before but replace the gravity force with a buoyancy force f_buoy that is derived from these variations. To simplify even further, we assume f_buoy depends linearly on T and s. letting the background ambient temp be T_amb (say 300k):

f_buoy = vec3(0, -alpha*s + beta*(T - T_amb), 0);

Where alpha and beta are non-negative constants which can be set by the user to achieve different behavior. Note that f_buoy = 0 where there's no smoke and the temp is at ambient level. We store T and s at grid centers. They are advected aroud with the fluid, but also slowly diffuse. just as we dropped the viscosity term in the momentum equation since the numerical dissipation mimics it anyhow, we need not explicitly model heat and smoke diffusion; they'll happen in our numerical methods whether we want them or not. Thus the material derviatives of both are set to 0.

For boundaries, temperature is T_amb outside the grid and the temp of the object inside the object. smoke concentration doesn't exist inside objects, except if its pouring out(with a non-zero boundary velocity) in which case we can set a source value for smoke inside the object. Otherwise we should extrapolate the smoke concentration into the object when asked for smoke inside an object, we interpolate from the closest values outside. 

= Vorticity Confinement =
A force which boosts the strength of vortices in the flow to counteract numerical dissipation. It tries to confine them and keep them from spreading out and dissipating.

We need the location and magnitude of these vortices.

SEE EQ (5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8) ON PAGE 59 FOR CALCULATING CONFINEMENT FORCE

= SHARPER INTERPOLATION =
Using linear interp in semi-Lagrangian advection quickly smears out shapr features in the temp and concentration fields (and vorticity confinement doesn't apply to these fields). We will use Fedkiw's particular choice of cubic interp designed to be accurate yet stable (avoids overshoot characteristic of cubic interp). The underlying scheme is catmull-rom spline. Given qi-1, qi, qi+1, qi+2 we watn to estimate q at a point xi between xi and xi+1. Note the coefficients presented in the Fedkiw paper have a typo, a missing 2 in the cubic term.

SEE 5.11 ON PAGE 60 FOR CUBIC INTERPOLANT AND FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS


==========================VISUALIZATION OF SMOKE (FEDKIW)==============================
Our Model:
uses coarse grids, inviscid euler equations to make it faster than the computationally intensive inviscid navier-stokes equations. Model smoke's velocity using semi-lagrangian integration scheme followed by a pressure-Poisson equation. Numerical dissipation is inherent in semi-Lagrangian schemes. To avoid this, vorticity confinement (a technique in CFD(computation fluid dynamics) literature) is used. This injects energy lost due to numerical dissipation back into the fluid using a forcing term. this force is designed specifically to increase the vorticity of the flow.  Visually this keeps the smoke alive over time. This term is consistent with Euler equations in the sense that it disappears as the number of grid cells is increased. The simulation remains stable as long as the magnitude of this forcing term is kept below a threshold.

The Equations of Fluid Flow:
Assume gases can be modeled as inviscid, incompressible, constant density fluids. The assumption of incompressibility greatlysimplifies numerical methods. smoke's velocity is vector u = (u, v, w). The quantity p is the pressure of the gas and f is external forces.little greek p (ro) is density (should be constant, fedkiw sets it arbitrarily to 1). 

the two equations at the bottom right of page two, governing conservation of mass(eq 1 divergence is 0) and momentum (eq 2). These equations are solved in to steps. first compute an intermediate velocity field u_star by solving eq 2 over time step delta t without the pressure term. after this step, force the field u_star to be incompressible using a project method[3]. The intermediate velocity field is made incompressible by subtracting the gradient of teh pressure from it.

The two eqations governing the smoke's temperature and pressure are on the right mid of page 2. These two scalar quantities are simply advected along the smoke's velocity. Both the density and the temperature affect teh fluid's velocity. Both density and temp affect the fluid's velocity. Heavy smoke tends to fall down due to gravity while hot gases tend to rise due to buoyancy. we use a simple model to account for these effects by defining extrenal forces that are directly proportional to the density and the temperature: see (8) mid right page 2. 

Vorticity Confinement:
one could generate a divergence free velocity field using a Kolmogorov spectrum and add this to  the computed flow field to represent the missing small scale structure; however, this puts it in non-sensical locations that look wrong. Instead vorticity confinment adds these small scale structures in locations where it should logically occur. Therefore the first step in generating small scale detail is to identify where it comes from: sufficient curl in the velocity field (9). First, normalized vorticity locaiton vectors that point from lower vorticity to higher vorticity concentrations are computed (10) (gradient of curl). Then the magnitude and direction of the "paddle wheel force" is computed (11). epsilon in the eq is used to control the amount of small scale detail aded back into the flow field and the dependence on the spatial discretization h guarantees that as the mesh is refiend the physically correct solution is still objained. 

Implementation:
simulation space is divided into equal sized boxes or voxels, formally defined in this particular case as a MAC grid. In the MAC-grid, the temperature, smoke's density and external forces are defined at the center of each voxel while the velocity is defined on the appropriate voxel faces. This staggered approach reduces numerical dissipation. See appendix A for more details on our discretization. We tag all voxels that intersect an object as being occupied. All occupied voxel cell faces have their velocity set to that of teh object. Similarly, the temp at the center of teh occupied voxels is set to the object's temp. The smoke's density is equal to 0 inside the object. To avoid sudden drop off of smoke density near the objects boundary, we set the density at the boundary voxels equal to the density of teh closest unoccupied voxel. 

Two voxel grids are needed, one is updated based on the state of teh other at each time step. At the end of each time step we swap the grids.  First we update the velocit components of the fluid. This is done in three steps:

1. add teh force fields to the velocity grid. the forces include user supplied fields, the buoyancy force defined by eq (8) and confinment eq (11). This is done by multiplying each force by the time step and adding it to the velocity(see appendix A). 

2. Solve for teh advection term in eq (3). we do this using a semi-Lagrangian scheme, see[19] for a review and [17] for its application in computer graphics. The semi-Lagrangian algo build a new grid of velocities from the ones already computed by tracing the midpoints of each voxel face through the velocity field. New velocities are then interpolated at these points and these points and their values are transferred to the face cells they originated from. It is possible that the point ends up in one of the occupied voxels. In this case we simply clip the path against the voxel boundary as shown in fig 2. this guarantees that the point always lies in the unoccupied fluid. simple linear interp is good enough, but higher order will give higher quality results. The tricky part with higher order interp is that they usually overshoot the data which results in instability. In appendix B we provide a cubic interp which does not overshoot.

3. Finally we force the velocity field to conserve mass. see eq (4). the discretization of this equalition in a sparse linear system of equations. we impose free neumann boundary conditions at the occupied voxels by setting the normal pressure gradient equal to zero at the occupied boundary faces. The system of eq. is symmetric so the most natural linear solver is the conjugate gradient method. To improve convergence of this method we used an incomplete choleski preconditioner. see the standard text on these techniques [11]. 20 iters was enough. After teh pressure is compute we subtract its gradient from the velocity. see appendix A for the exact discretization of the operators involved. 

After the velocity is updated we advect both the temperature and smoke's dnesity. we solve these equations using again a semi-lagrangian scheme. In this case, however, we trace back the centers of each voxel. the interp scheme is similar in the velocity case.  


=====================STABLE FLUIDS (STAM)========================
introduced an unconditionally stable model so that you don't have to used extremely small time step. Achieved using semi-lagrangian advection scheme and implicit solvers. Because a first order intergration scheme was used, the sims suffer from too much numerical dissipation and although it looks fluid-like, small scale vortices characteristic of smoke vanish too rapidly. For rendering, it advects 'solid textures'.

Jos Stam mentions tutuorial-like resources for fluid dynamics. These include [11](easier), [3](harder), as well as Foster and Metaxis paper that Stam's paper builds off of [6],[7] (not sure which one he's talking about).

Stable Navier-Stokes:
boundary condition sounds like gram-schmidt normalization where you subtract off the component of teh velocity field that is normal to the boundary. Fig1: one simulation step of our solver is composed of several steps. The first three steps may take the field out of the space of divergent free fields. the last projection step ensures that the field is divergent free after the entire sim step. Fig2: To solve for the advection part, we trace each point of the field backward in time. The new veloctiy at x is therfore the velocicty that the particle had a time delta t ago at the old location p(x, -deltaT).

Method of Solution:
we resolve eq 5 over the time span deltaT in four steps by sequentially resolving each term on the right hand side of eq 5 followed by a projection onto the divergent free fields, we start with the solution of the previous time step w0(x) and work towards the solution for the current time step w4(x): 
w0(x) --> add force --> w1(x) --> advect --> w2(x) --> diffuse --> w3(x) --> project --> w4(x)
The solution is then given by the last velocity field: u(x, t+deltaT) = w4(x). For force, w1(x) = w0(x) + deltaT*f(x,t). To maintain stability you must implicitly solve for velocity at point x for t+deltaT by backtracing the point x through tthe velocity field w1 over a time deltaT. This defines a path  p(x, s) corresponding to a partial streamline of the velocity field. The new velocity at the point x is then set to the velocity that the eparticle, now at x, had at its previous location a time deltaT ago: w2(x) = w1(p(x, -deltaT)). The reason this is stable is that the max val of the new field is never larger than the largest val of the previous field. The third step solves for the effect of viscosity. w3 is solved using an equation on page three with the identity operator. The diffusion operator (upside down triangle squared (dotted with itself)) is discretized and leads to a sparse linear system for the unknown field w3. The fourth step involves the projection step, which makes the resulting field divergence free, this involves the resolution of the Poisson problem defined by eq 4. The projection step, therefore, requires a good Poisson solver. The Poisson equation, when spatially discretized, becomes a sparse linear system. Therefore, both the projection and the viscosity steps involve the solution of a large sparse system of eq. 

Solver setup:
2 grids used for calculating and swapping, everything defined at cell centers (no staggered grid). Another 2 grids used to track advecting other scalar quantities through the velocity fields.
